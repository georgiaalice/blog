                <h3>Problem Solving and Being Lazy</h3>
                <p>Problem solving is breaking down a task into single focus tasks and solving them while sill being aware of the problem as a whole.

Be aware of meta-problems which are problems that you need to solve in order to solve other problems.

Record what the problems are and the solutions that you have come up with so that you can come up with it later, especially when you have been taken out of the context and need to get back into it 
(context-switching).

One way to do this is through a journaled-file system which is when you record something that you need to do, and when you complete the task so that you always keep track of what you are doing (also good for context switching).

Need to record what you are doing, why you're doing it, and in which context you're doing it. Also, how well you're doing and how much more work you are required to do in order to finish (can be represented in a burn down chart).

Being lazy is about doing the smallest amount of work possible. Ask yourself; has someone else written it before? Also, try to avoid premature optimization (making something better/faster than it needs to be. Remember DRY (don't repeat yourself) and KISS (keep it simple stupid). But don't cut corner! In other terms, being lazy is doing a job in the easiest way, but still doing an excellent job.</p>
